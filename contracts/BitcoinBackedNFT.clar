;; Title: Bitcoin-Backed NFT Platform

;; Summary:
;; This smart contract implements a Bitcoin-backed NFT platform on the Stacks blockchain. It allows users to mint, transfer, stake, and burn NFTs backed by real-world assets. Additionally, it includes a governance token mechanism for rewarding NFT staking.

;; Description:
;; The Bitcoin-Backed NFT Platform provides a comprehensive solution for managing NFTs tied to real-world assets. Key features include:
;; - **Minting NFTs**: Users can mint new NFTs by providing a unique token ID, asset type, and asset value.
;; - **Transferring NFTs**: NFTs can be transferred between users with checks to ensure the sender is the owner and the NFT is not actively staked.
;; - **Staking NFTs**: Owners can stake their NFTs to earn governance tokens as rewards. Staking information is tracked, and rewards are calculated based on the asset value and staking duration.
;; - **Unstaking NFTs**: Users can unstake their NFTs to claim rewards. The staking information is reset, and governance tokens are credited to the user's account.
;; - **Burning NFTs**: Owners can burn their NFTs, provided they are not staked, to remove them from circulation.
;; - **Governance Token Redemption**: Users can redeem their accumulated governance tokens for equivalent value or governance actions.

;; The contract includes various error handling mechanisms to ensure secure and authorized operations. It also provides read-only functions to retrieve NFT metadata and governance token balances.
